This project is in its very early stages (i.e. don't look at this repo)

Project on AUDL (AUDL.com) stats using Python.

Questions to answer:
- Looking at possession based offenses vs. non-possession based offenses: see how this compares with scoring rate.
-- Which teams throw the most hucks? Which teams don't?
-- On receiving, what is the % chance of scoring. After one pass, what is it. After 2 passes, etc
-- Which teams should throw more hucks and which should not?
